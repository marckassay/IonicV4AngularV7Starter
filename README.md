# IonicV4AngularV7Starter

This is a working starter for Ionic's sidemenu with Angular. At the moment of development, Ionic CLI creates a starter without demostrating the usages of Angular's Router. That issue has been documented [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/starters/issues/603). 

This Ionic starter is developed following closly to Angular's example that is posted in this [article](https://angular.io/guide/router#the-sample-application) and combining it with Ionic's sidemenu starter.
